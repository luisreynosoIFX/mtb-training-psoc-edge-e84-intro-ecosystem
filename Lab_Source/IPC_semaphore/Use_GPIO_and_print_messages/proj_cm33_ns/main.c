* Summary:
* This is the main function of the CM33 non-secure application. 
* 
* It initializes the device and board peripherals. It also initializes the 
* retarget-io middleware to be used with the debug UART port using which 
* "Hello World!" is printed on the debug UART. The LED pin is initialized with
* default configurations. The CM55 core is enabled and then the programs enters
* an infinite while loop which toggles the LED1 with a frequency of 1 Hz.
*
* Parameters:
*  none
*
* Return:
*  int
